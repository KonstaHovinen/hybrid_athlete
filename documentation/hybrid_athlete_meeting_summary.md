# Hybrid Athlete – Meeting Summary

**Developer:** Self-initiated project for academic credit recognition
**Date:** 7.1.2026

---

## 1. Project Overview

Hybrid Athlete is a **personal fitness tracking application** for hybrid athletes combining strength training, running, and team sports (like futsal). It was developed to replace fragmented apps that do not meet personal workflow and feature requirements.

**Key Points:**
- Cross-platform Flutter app (currently Android emulation; future Windows/macOS/iOS/web planned)
- ~140 features across workout logging, futsal tracking, analytics, and gamification
- Fully offline and self-contained
- Self-developed UI/UX with a dark modern theme

---

## 2. Key Features (Highlights)

**Workout & Session Management:**
- Gym workouts, running sessions, and futsal game logging
- Schedule workouts via calendar
- Edit and track workout history

**Analytics & Feedback:**
- Weekly statistics, personal records, and streak tracking
- Progress comparison and goal achievement overview

**User Engagement:**
- Badge and goal system
- Editable profile and custom templates
- Quick log for rapid entry of exercises

**Exercise System:**
- Smart exercise detection: recovery, sprint, gym modes
- Custom exercises and templates
- Multi-set logging with auto-suggestions for weight and reps

---

## 3. Technical Highlights

- **Feature-based folder structure** with pragmatic, evolving architecture
- **State management:** Vanilla Flutter (`StatefulWidget` + `setState()`)
- **Local storage:** SharedPreferences with JSON serialization
- **Cross-platform considerations:** Time zones, UI density, storage paths
- **Scalable for personal use** (~1000 workouts expected without migration)

---

## 4. Learning Outcomes

- Learned Flutter and Dart from scratch
- Developed cross-platform UI/UX skills
- Solved real-world problems with state management, offline storage, and data modeling
- Improved personal training accountability by using the app daily
- Gained experience in iterative, feature-driven development and practical problem solving

---

## 5. Future Directions

- Smooth out Windows and other platform deployments
- Potential controlled testing with friends or sports clubs
- Incremental feature expansion (analytics, social/private networks)
- Maintain a living documentation reflecting ongoing development
